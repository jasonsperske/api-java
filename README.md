# api-java

This is a language-specific API client for [ReadMe Build](https://readme.build). It's based on the [api spec](https://github.com/readmeio/api-spec).

This implementation works around Let's Encrypt issues (in Java releases earlier than 1.8.u101 and with minimal dependancies, so it should fit into any project.
